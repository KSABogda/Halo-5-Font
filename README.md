# Halo-5-Font
By: UncookedMoa

>:/TRANSMISSION START/:<
It's been 7 years (at the time of typing this readme) since 343 took over and made their own modifications to the Reach font with the release of Combat Evolved Anniversary in 2011. So far, making a font for this hasn't ever been brought up, with most assuming that the Halo 5 font is the same as the Reach font, and with the Halo Reach font having not been made for 8 years, most have simply given up hope.

Today, UncookedMoa brings you a font based on 343's revisions on the Halo logo. While bearing many similarities, the logo is distinctly different from Reach's. Take note of the letter "A" being cut out in a different spot, and the letter "O" more closely resembling the original Halo font. Also take note that 343's Halo logo design is thicker than Reach's. I'd describe 343's Halo logo design as thicker and less "pointy", featuring more diagonal lines. This sleeker look helps in providing a more futuristic feel, which fits the stronger Forerunner focus of the 343 Halo games.

Letters and numbers have all been overhauled, including the characters for the numbers "2" and "3", for hypothetical "Anniversary" designs. The number "2" is not lifted from Halo 2 Anniversary, however, in favor of a custom design. I personally felt that the "2" in Halo 2 Anniversary's trailers was out of place for the Halo 5 font, looking as though it was from a different font entirely.

This Halo 5 font is of my own design, and was made after some practice with the Halo Reach font. As such, I personally feel this was better made than the Reach font. However, again, it's far from perfect. This is the second font of an amateur with zero classes in calligraphy. I apologize for any imperfections you may spot.

I am available on Discord as UncookedMoa#9730 (Profile picture with a Moa logo) and also have a YouTube channel of the same name. I mainly create music videos and trailers, however. Focus is not necessarily Halo, but most of the content is definitely Halo. I also happen to have a channel dedicated to archiving fan made Halo music, known as "AwesomeHaloMusic." You can check either of the two channels out, if you'd like.

>:/OTHER FONTS BY UNCOOKEDMOA HALO FANS WILL BE INTERESTED IN/:<

- Halo 3 Font Fixed
It's Will Turnbow's Halo 3 font, but with the question mark finally fixed. For too long have we worked with an upside down question mark in the Halo 3 font. No more.

- Halo Reach Font:
At last, 8 years after its release (at the time of typing this readme), a font based on Bungie's 2010 Halo logo revision for Halo Reach finally exists. Every letter has been updated accordingly, and the numbers "4" and "5" have been updated to coincide with the official designs in Halo 4 and 5.
